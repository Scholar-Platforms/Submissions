# Submissions
We're building a truly reproducible version of our scientific record, because science is about independent replicability, not prestigious citation.

Want to contribute? Head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tJmw3UdYZV) to join the community and get involved!

Here's [an example of the Ethereum Whitepaper](https://usescholar.org/research/0). Ideally we'd add the PDF, code, data, and a notebook for easy reproducibility.

## Requirements

A rough list of things we need to get research on-chain through Scholar. This process and this list will evolve over time.

We'll definitely automate whatever parts we can. We're working on an API at the moment.


1. Pick an open-access research paper to add
    1. Some places to start finding papers:
        1. Add to a web of citations that’s already [on Scholar](https://usescholar.org/research)
        2. Pick one from the [list of top publications we've curated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtyLJXxYL3c4npu4RJ6VwGhbOS5tzbNx_ov6YPsu_bU/edit?usp=sharing)
            - [Open-Access Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Colour_naming_system)
        3. [10 Most Important White Papers in Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/02/13/satoshi--company-the-10-most-important-scientific-white-papers-in-development-of-cryptocurrencies/?sh=75ccb2dd2057)
        4. [Landmark Papers in Machine Learning](https://github.com/daturkel/learning-papers)
        5. [List of important publications in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_computer_science)
2. Check [CC licensing](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/): We can use CC0, CC BY and CC BY-NC
    1. [HowCanIShareIt](https://www.howcanishareit.com/) enables us to check licensing using DOIs
    2. Some journals/platforms maybe require specific attribution — we must conform to those attribution requirements
    3. [Additional information](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#for-licensees) on using CC-licensed material
3. Reach out to the author to obtain permission to share, and to get the associated code and data
    1. Ideally we'd be able to reproduce the figures and results of the paper
    1. We can also check Zenodo, Protocols.io, PapersWithCode, and Figshare for associated artifacts
4. Upload code and data to Github (if there isn’t already a repository)
    1. Ideally we’d create the repository under the [Scholar organization](https://github.com/Scholar-Platforms) (Reach out to Manveer if you need help with this)
5. Fill out `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` and submit a Pull Request on this Github repository.
