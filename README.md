# Submissions
We're taking existing research papers and adding them on-chain in reproducible format. [Checkout what we've got so far](https://usescholar.org/research), or learn more about [our mission](https://usescholar.org/about)!

# Contribute

Want to contribute? Head over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tJmw3UdYZV) to join the community and get involved!

Here's [an example of the Ethereum Whitepaper](https://usescholar.org/research/0). Ideally we'd add the PDF, code, data, and a notebook for easy reproducibility.

## Requirements

A rough list of requirements to get research on-chain through Scholar. This process and these requirements will evolve over time.

We'll definitely automate whatever parts we can. We're working on an API at the moment.


1. Pick a research paper to add
    1. Some places to start finding papers:
        1. Add to a web of citations that’s already [on Scholar](https://usescholar.org/research)
        2. [10 Most Important White Papers in Cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/02/13/satoshi--company-the-10-most-important-scientific-white-papers-in-development-of-cryptocurrencies/?sh=75ccb2dd2057)
        3. [Landmark Papers in Machine Learning](https://github.com/daturkel/learning-papers)
        4. [List of important publications in computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_computer_science)
2. Check [CC licensing](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/): We can use CC0, CC BY and CC BY-NC
    1. [HowCanIShareIt](https://www.howcanishareit.com/) enables us to check licensing using DOIs
    2. Some journals/platforms maybe require specific attribution — we must conform to those attribution requirements
    3. [Additional information](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#for-licensees) on using CC-licensed material
3. Reach out to the author to obtain permission to share, and to get the associated code and data
    1. Ideally we'd be able to reproduce the figures and results of the paper
4. Upload code and data to Github (if there isn’t already a repository)
    1. Ideally we’d create the repository under the [Scholar organization](https://github.com/Scholar-Platforms) (Reach out to Manveer if you need help with this)
5. Fill out `SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md` and submit a Pull Request on this Github repository.


If you get stuck or need help, reach out in the `#contribute` channel in our Discord.
